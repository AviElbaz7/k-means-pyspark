# K-Means Clustering with PySpark

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using PySpark.

## Contents

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Steps to load and preprocess the data for clustering.
- **K-Means Algorithm**: Implementation of the K-Means algorithm in PySpark.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Interpretation of results and visualization of clusters.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- PySpark

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the notebook (`k means pyspark.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell.

## Notes

- Ensure you have a working Spark environment set up. Refer to the [official Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) for setup instructions.
- The dataset used for clustering should be available in the specified path in the notebook.
